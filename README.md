**This project was a prototype. This code base is abandoned and is not supported.**

As a result of experience of this work new solutions were sucessfully implemented.

# Asterisk inside Odoo - PBX & Dev platform
Imagine all Asterisk PBX features covered around by Odoo.

Static or RealTime, scaling from Embedded PBX to unlimited number of servers in the cloud with central management.

## Project description
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/M0LlN3_Wy3c/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0LlN3_Wy3c)


This project is Asterisk Management system and also Asterisk development platform based on [Odoo](http://odoo.com).

Currently implemented features:
* **Multi server management** - many Asterisk servers are managed from one place.
* **Asterisk .conf files editor** with Asterisk syntax highlight. Configuration files are stored in Odoo database and delivered to Asterisk server via Asterisk internal HTTP server.
* **Asterisk WEB console** with colors.
* **Stasis apps server** implementing different business logic, e.g. set callerid name from Odoo contacts.
* **Call QoS reporting** on every CDR.
* **CEL (Channel event logging)** on every call.
* **Call Recording** with automatic download and cleanup (embedded pbx ready).
* **Apps**
 * **SIP** users and trunks management, peer registration history and statistics.
 * More to come...


## Project Components
### odoo-addons
This folder contains Odoo modules. You should update your odoo.conf and append path to this folder.
```
[options]
addons_path =  /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/odoo/addons,/opt/odoo_asterisk/odoo-addons
```

Don't forget to activate *developer mode* and update apps list so that Odoo knows about these modules!

Also this folder contains requirements for Odoo, you can install them from pip:

```sh
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### PostgreSQL preparations
Before installing Odoo Asterisk addon modules you have to create PostgreSQL role for Asterisk (set your own password!):

```sql
template1=# create user asterisk with password 'asterisk';
CREATE ROLE
template1=#
```

### agent
This folder contains Asterisk agent that should be deployed on your Asterisk server.
Currently the agent gives a WEB Asterisk CLI in Odoo.

You should create a python environment using requirements.txt and run the agent.

Clone this repo on your Asterisk server, create python virtual environment, go to *agent* folder and run
```
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python asterisk_helper.py
```
After that go to Odoo and set Asterisk CLI URL	in server's settings to (for example if your asterisk server is on 192.168.1.1):
```
ws://192.168.1.1:8010/websocket
```
*Save*, go to Console tab and click *Edit* to activate Asterisk CLI. Click *Discard* to leave the console.

### services
This folder contains additional helper applications:
* **stasis_apps.py** - Asterisk Stasis Application implementing different services, e.g. setting callerid name from Odoo contacts.
* **ami_broker.py** - AMI client for asterisk used for example to catch Hangup event to download call recording.

You should create a virtualenvironment using this folder's requirements.txt and run both scripts.
See conf.py for configuration settings

## After installation
### Trigger for CEL
Go to PgSQL console and run:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_cel_cdr_field() RETURNS trigger AS $$
        BEGIN
        UPDATE asterisk_cel set cdr = NEW.id
            WHERE asterisk_cel.uniqueid = NEW.uniqueid;
        RETURN NULL;
        END; $$ LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';

        DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_cel_cdr_field  on asterisk_cdr;
        CREATE TRIGGER update_cel_cdr_field AFTER INSERT on asterisk_cdr
            FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE update_cel_cdr_field();
```

Create role for Asterisk
```
GRANT ALL on asterisk_cdr to asterisk;
GRANT ALL on asterisk_sip_peer to asterisk;
GRANT ALL on asterisk_cdr_id_seq to asterisk;
GRANT ALL on asterisk_cel to asterisk;
GRANT ALL on asterisk_cel_id_seq to asterisk;
GRANT SELECT on asterisk_context to asterisk;
GRANT SELECT on asterisk_conf_extensions to asterisk;
````

Run odoo with `--workers=N` where N > 1. This automatically enables odoo to listen on port 8072 where ami_brocker.py service connects.
